# Azure Blob Storage Upload

This project demonstrates how to upload files to Azure Blob Storage. The focus of the project is on automating the process of uploading files using Azure SDKs and commands. Below is an overview of what was learned and implemented.

## Key Features
- **Azure Blob Storage Setup**: Learn how to set up Azure Blob Storage in the Azure portal.
- **Upload Process**: Automate file uploads using Azure CLI, PowerShell, and SDKs.
- **Security Measures**: Ensuring secure access using Shared Access Signatures (SAS).
- **Error Handling**: Implementing error handling and retry mechanisms for reliable uploads.

## Technologies Used
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Core component for file storage.
- **Azure CLI**: Used for managing Azure resources and uploading files.
- **PowerShell**: For script automation.
- **Azure SDKs**: For managing and interacting with Azure services.

## Steps to Set Up
1. Create a **Storage Account** in Azure.
2. Create a **Blob Container**.
3. Generate a **SAS Token** for secure file upload access.
4. Use the **Azure CLI** or **PowerShell** to upload files.
5. Automate the upload process with a script.

## Learnings
- How to work with **Azure Storage Accounts** and **Blob Containers**.
- Using **Shared Access Signatures (SAS)** to grant secure access.
- Automating tasks with **Azure CLI** and **PowerShell**.

## Future Improvements
