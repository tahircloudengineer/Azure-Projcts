# Azure Active Directory (Microsoft Entra ID) Hands-On Project

## **Objective**
To explore and manage Azure Active Directory, now known as Microsoft Entra ID, to understand its capabilities for identity and access management.

## **Steps Performed**
1. **Created an Azure AD B2C Tenant**:
   - Set up a new tenant for testing and hands-on learning.

2. **Added Users and Groups**:
   - Created users and organized them into groups for efficient management.

3. **Assigned Roles**:
   - Assigned roles such as "Contributor" and "Reader" to users for role-based access control.

4. **Tested Applications**:
   - Linked the tenant to a sample SaaS application for testing.

## **Skills Practiced**
- Tenant creation in Microsoft Entra ID.
- User and group management.
