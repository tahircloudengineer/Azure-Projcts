# Azure Storage Account and Blob Storage

## Objective:
This project demonstrates how to create and manage an Azure Storage Account and Blob Storage. It includes steps to create a Storage Account, Blob Containers, upload files, configure access policies, and generate Shared Access Signatures (SAS) for secure, temporary access.

## Steps:

1. **Create a Storage Account:**
   - Log in to the Azure Portal and navigate to "Storage Accounts."
   - Create a new Storage Account with a unique name, choose the appropriate region, and select the performance and replication options.

2. **Create a Blob Container:**
   - In the Storage Account, navigate to the "Containers" section and create a Blob Container to store the files.

3. **Upload Files to Blob Container:**
   - Upload files such as text files, images, or documents to the Blob container.

4. **Configure Access Policies:**
   - Set the access level to either private or public. In this project, anonymous access is blocked for enhanced security.

5. **Create Shared Access Signature (SAS):**
   - Generate a SAS token to allow temporary, secure access to the Blob Storage for specific users or applications.

6. **Download Files from Blob Storage:**
   - Use the SAS URL or public URL to download the files from the Blob Storage.

## Skills Covered:
- Azure Storage Account Creation
- Blob Storage Management
- Configuring Access Policies
- Generating SAS Tokens
- File Upload and Download in Azure Blob Storage
